This work is for testing purpose :

I am trying to check whether this calculator program is producing correct results or not.

In ans variable i am giving the precomputed result that should be returned by the calculator. If both are equal then returning match.

In advanced part (sin, cos, tan, cot, cosec, and sec)
these are only being calculated.
